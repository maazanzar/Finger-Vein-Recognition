# Finger-View-Recognition
This repository is a matlab based Finger vein Recognition system repository.
It contains code of matlab for vien recongnition system.
To run this project user either has to make Finger scanner it self using A box , IR led, stand to place finger, and converted webcam into IR cam this will guide https://www.instructables.com/id/turn-webcam-to-IR-sensitive-camera/ or user has to change code and use already saved images in the 'Images with Feature', 'Scanned Images', 'Features' folders.Please read 'Biometric-Finger-Vein-Authentication.docx' for further guide about Vien Scanner and Vien Recognition Code of matlab.
